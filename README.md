# 🌞 Solar Flare Early Warning using Attention LSTM

An end-to-end deep learning system for **early solar flare risk forecasting** combining RHESSI flare events, temporal activity features, and GOES X-ray flux.

The project explores how sequence models capture precursor activity and evaluates performance using space-weather metrics such as **ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and TSS**.

## 🚀 Overview

Solar flares are rare, high-impact space-weather events that can affect satellites, communication systems, and power grids.

Traditional classification approaches struggle due to extreme class imbalance and temporal buildup before flares.

This project reframes flare prediction as an **early warning time-series problem** using:

- Event sequences  
- Activity memory features  
- Physical X-ray flux (GOES)  
- Attention-based LSTM  

The system outputs **probabilistic risk timelines** instead of simple binary predictions.
